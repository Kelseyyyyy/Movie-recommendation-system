# Movie-recommendation-system
This is a simple movie recommendation system built using Python and collaborative filtering. It analyzes user ratings to suggest movies that a user might like based on the preferences of similar users. The system uses a user-item matrix and cosine similarity to calculate which users are most alike, then recommends movies they enjoyed.
